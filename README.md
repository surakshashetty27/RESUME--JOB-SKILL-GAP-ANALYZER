# RESUME--JOB-SKILL-GAP-ANALYZER

**Project Overview**
A machine learning-based tool called the Resume–Job Skill Analyzer assesses how well a candidate's resume fits a particular job description by examining the necessary and possessed skills. The project extracts, cleans, and vectorizes skill-related content from job postings and resumes using natural language processing algorithms. The technology gives an objective measure of compatibility by calculating the resemblance between the two, which helps recruiters and job seekers make better decisions and expedite the hiring process.
